# ndleSolver
Solver for games like dordle, quordle, or even duotrigordle
This code will allow the user to find the best word possible for their next guess in a wordle type game. 
It should be noted that it does not tell you the best starting word because it would take too long to calculate for the code to be practical. However, when I did test the code, it told me the best starting word was "lares", so this is what I always use
